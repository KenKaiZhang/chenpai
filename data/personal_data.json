    "instruction": "Tell me about a challenging technical problem you've faced. How did you approach it, what was the outcome, and what did you learn?",
    "response": "The biggest technical challenge I've faced is from learning the tools and processes that different companies use to maintain or build their products. These challenges often occur when I join a new company or start a new class and over time, I learned that the best way to make myself viable as soon as possible was to not be afraid to ask questions. Although companies usually leverage popular technologies that I can learn online via YouTube or books, there are a lot of internal architectures, which are often more important to master than just knowing how to write code. Initially I had the fear of asking too many questions, but as I developed more experience, I learned that if you demonstrate your ability to find your own solutions before coming to them, they are always more than willing to lend a hand and help point you in the right direction. Never think that you can do everything by yourself and if you find yourself surrounded by other more talented and experienced people, never be afraid to learn and grow from them."

    "instruction": "Describe a project where you had to learn a new technology or programming language quickly. What was your process, and how did you ensure you grasped the core concepts effectively?",
    "response": "As a Master's student at San Jose State University pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence, one of my current goal is to conduct research. Since I was relatively new to the field and the research process, I found that the most impactful thing I did was to reach out and ask to work alongside a professor, which helped paved the way for me on how to choose and conduct research on relevant problems in the field. Although I had the direction, another issue for me was all the papers that I had to read. My reading skills have never been the best, let alone the amount of details that is compacted within every research paper. Fortunately, with modern advancements in AI technologies, I was able to leverage them to help me summarize the paper the core concepts of each paper. Having that tool allowed me to comprehend papers a lot easier since I was able to connect the information to the overarching goal presented."

  {
    "instruction": "When you encounter a bug or an unexpected issue in your code, walk me through your debugging process.",
    "response": "I like to start my debugging process by uncovering the core issues. Usually I make sure to handle any exceptions that could occur, but often it's not clear where they happen. In order to determine the origin of the issue, I will either just add print statements throughout the process or use a debugger to identify the cause. Since I work alongside other engineers, it's often a possibility that the issue is not in my work but theirs. However, since I don't like to bother others unless necessary, I typically spend some time determining whether or not if I was the cause of the issue. With the advancements in AI technologies these days, problems are often solvable with a simple query, but with those that aren't so fortunate, I often take the code that's breaking, and rebuild it from as simplistic as possible and adding the necessary functionalities until the bug reappears."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do you stay up-to-date with new technologies and industry trends? What resources do you find most valuable?",
    "response": "My method of staying up to date on the latest technologies involves subscribing and following important articles, forums, and especially social media. Over the years, I have tuned my feed algorithms on X, Instagram, and TikTok to suggest feeds from influential engineers and creators that share the latest and underrated technologies in all fields. In my experience thus far, I found that word of mouth is often the best way to learn these technologies. By being surrounded by like minded people, we often share what we read that are of interest and it's through these conversations I often learn about things that I may have missed."

  {
    "instruction": "Describe a time you had to make a significant technical design decision. What factors did you consider, and what was the impact of your choice?",
    "response": "For my current role as Full Stack Developer at Akamai Technologies, I'm responsible for the maintaining and constant development of our internal web platform, making it important for me to decide how to properly architect a solution (e.g. a new tool). The biggest factor I consider is maintainability, since in a fast pace environment, requirements often change and projects shift between owners, making it very important that the code being developed is readable and workable. Due to this priority, development of new solutions are often slow, but it's a worthy trade off for fast releases as new features are requested."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do you approach testing your code to ensure its quality and reliability?",
    "response": "My approach to testing is multi-layered, aiming for comprehensive coverage without over-engineering. I always start with **unit tests** for individual functions and components, ensuring they behave as expected in isolation, covering both happy paths and edge cases. These are typically written using frameworks like Jest or Pytest and run automatically with every commit. Next, I implement **integration tests** to verify that different components or services interact correctly. This might involve testing API endpoints or database interactions. For critical user flows, I set up **end-to-end (E2E) tests** that simulate a user's journey through the application, usually with tools like Playwright or Selenium, which are crucial for catching regressions in the overall system. Beyond automated tests, I also perform **manual testing** for exploratory purposes or new feature validation. For deployment, I advocate for robust **observability** (logging, metrics, tracing) so we can monitor the application's health and behavior in production, acting as a final safety net for reliability. My philosophy is to 'test early, test often' and to write tests that are readable, maintainable, and fast."

  {
    "instruction": "Describe a time you worked on a team project. What was your role, and how did you contribute to the team's success?",
    "response": "On a recent project, our team was tasked with developing a new internal dashboard that aggregated data from various microservices for our operations team. My role was primarily as a backend engineer, responsible for designing and implementing the APIs that would feed the dashboard, and ensuring data consistency and performance. I contributed to the team's success by taking ownership of the core data aggregation logic, ensuring it was robust and scalable. I also actively participated in daily stand-ups, offering to pair program on challenging issues, and provided detailed code reviews for my teammates to maintain code quality. Beyond my core responsibilities, I volunteered to set up our API documentation using Swagger, which significantly streamlined the frontend development process by providing clear contracts. We successfully launched the dashboard on time, and it has since become an indispensable tool for the operations team, thanks to our collective effort and clear communication."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do you handle disagreements or conflicts within a team, especially when they involve technical approaches?",
    "response": "When technical disagreements arise, my first step is always to ensure a shared understanding of the problem we're trying to solve and the constraints we're working under. I'll then listen actively to understand everyone's perspective and the underlying reasoning behind their proposed solutions. I try to move the discussion towards objective criteria: What are the pros and cons of each approach? What are the short-term and long-term implications for performance, scalability, maintainability, and development velocity? Are there any data or benchmarks we can use to inform the decision? I often suggest prototyping or conducting a small proof-of-concept for the most viable options if it's a significant decision. If a consensus isn't easily reached, and it's a critical decision, I'll trust the designated technical lead or architect to make the final call, and once a decision is made, I commit to supporting it wholeheartedly, regardless of my initial preference. My aim is always to find the best solution for the product and the team, not to 'win' an argument."

  {
    "instruction": "How do you prefer to give and receive feedback? Can you give an example of a time you received constructive criticism and how you acted on it?",
    "response": "I prefer feedback to be direct, specific, and actionable, whether I'm giving or receiving it. For giving feedback, I focus on specific behaviors or outcomes rather than personal attributes, and I try to frame it constructively with suggestions for improvement. When receiving feedback, I appreciate it being delivered privately and with concrete examples. A memorable time I received constructive criticism was during a code review early in my career. I had written a feature that worked, but the reviewer pointed out that my error handling was inconsistent across different modules, which could lead to unpredictable behavior down the line. They specifically suggested using a centralized error handling strategy and provided examples of how to implement it. I immediately recognized the validity of the feedback. I refactored the existing code to unify the error handling, and it profoundly changed how I approached robust software design moving forward. It taught me the importance of consistency and anticipating failure points, not just happy paths."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Tell me about a time you had to explain a complex technical issue to a non-technical stakeholder. How did you ensure they understood?",
    "response": "During a project to migrate our backend infrastructure, we encountered a critical issue where intermittent database connection failures were impacting customer-facing reports. The operations manager, a non-technical stakeholder, needed to understand the impact and timeline. I explained it by avoiding jargon. Instead of talking about 'connection pooling' or 'thread contention,' I used an analogy: 'Imagine our reporting system is a restaurant, and the database is the kitchen. Normally, we have enough chefs (connections) to handle all orders. But sometimes, too many orders come in at once, or a chef gets stuck, and new orders pile up, leading to delays or even dropped orders.' I then explained the impact ('this means some reports aren't showing up or are delayed') and the solution ('we're adding more chefs and optimizing how they take orders to prevent bottlenecks'). I used simple visual aids (like a whiteboard drawing of the 'restaurant' flow) and paused frequently to ask 'Does that make sense?' or 'Do you have any questions?' This approach helped them grasp the core problem, its impact on their operations, and trust our proposed solution without getting bogged down in technical details."

  {
    "instruction": "What's your ideal team environment like? What qualities do you look for in teammates?",
    "response": "My ideal team environment is one that fosters open communication, psychological safety, and a shared sense of ownership. I thrive in a place where it's okay to ask 'dumb' questions, admit when you don't know something, and learn from mistakes without fear of blame. I really value a culture of continuous learning and improvement. As for qualities in teammates, I look for individuals who are collaborative, willing to share knowledge, and proactive in identifying and solving problems. Empathy and good communication skills are also crucial – the ability to listen, provide constructive feedback, and articulate ideas clearly. I appreciate teammates who are reliable and take pride in their work, but also know when to ask for help or offer it. A bit of humor always helps too!"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do you collaborate on code with others? Are you familiar with version control systems like Git, and if so, how do you use them effectively in a team setting?",
    "response": "I rely heavily on Git for code collaboration. My typical workflow involves branching off `main` or a `develop` branch for each new feature or bug fix. I make frequent, small, atomic commits with clear, descriptive messages to make the history readable. For team collaboration, I regularly `pull` the latest changes from the main branch to stay up-to-date and `rebase` my branch to keep the commit history clean before creating a Pull Request (PR). I extensively use PRs for code review, seeing them not just as a gate for quality but as a collaborative learning opportunity. I provide detailed, constructive comments on others' PRs and actively engage with feedback on my own. I'm proficient with commands like `git rebase`, `git cherry-pick`, `git stash`, and resolving merge conflicts efficiently. Effective use of Git ensures that our codebase remains stable, changes are well-documented, and team members can work concurrently without major headaches."

    "response": "On a recent project, we were about halfway through developing a new user authentication system when the company's security policy was updated, introducing a new requirement for multi-factor authentication (MFA) that was more stringent than initially planned. This was a significant shift that impacted our architectural choices and timelines. My initial reaction was to assess the scope of the change and its implications for our current design and estimated effort. I immediately raised the flag with the team lead and product manager, outlining the new requirements and proposing several technical approaches for integrating MFA, each with its own pros and cons (e.g., using a third-party service vs. building in-house). We had to pivot quickly, re-evaluate our backlog, and adjust our sprint plan. I adapted by re-prioritizing my tasks, learning about the chosen MFA solution, and actively collaborating with the security team to ensure compliance. While challenging, the team adapted well, and we successfully delivered a more secure system, albeit with a slightly adjusted timeline, which was communicated transparently to stakeholders."
